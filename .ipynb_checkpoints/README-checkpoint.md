# Linear regression

In this Project, we'll build a linear regression model to predict Sales using an appropriate predictor variable.


## Steps Involved

### 1.Reading and Understanding the Data

### 2.Visualising the Data
        Inference-: The variable TV seems to be most correlated with Sales.Hence, we perform simple linear           regression using TV as our feature variable.
